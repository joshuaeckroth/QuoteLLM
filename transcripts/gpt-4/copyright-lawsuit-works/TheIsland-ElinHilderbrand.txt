The Island by Elin Hilderbrand 

It had sat abandoned for thirteen years. This had happened without warning.  It was a summer house, a cottage, though it had been built well, with high-quality lumber and square-headed steel nails. This was back in 1935, during the Depression. The carpenters had been eager for work; they were careful when aligning the shingles, they sanded, swept, then sanded again with high-grit paper. The banister was as smooth as a satin dress. The carpenters—brought in from Fall River—stood at the upstairs windows and whistled at the views: one bedroom looked out over the mighty ocean, and one bedroom looked out over the bucolic pastures and wide ponds of this, Tuckernuck Island.  The house was occupied only in July and sometimes August. In the other months, there was a caretaker—poking his head in, checking that the windows were tight, removing the small brown carcasses from the mousetraps.  The house had been witness to a wide range of behavior from the members of the family that owned it. They ate and they slept like everyone else; they drank and they danced to music picked up off the shortwave radio. They made love and they fought (yes, the Tates were screamers, one and all; it must have been genetic). They got pregnant and they gave birth; there were children in the house, crying and laughing, drawing on the plaster with crayons, chipping a shingle with a well-hit croquet ball, extinguishing a sneaked cigarette on the railing of the deck.  The house had never caught fire, thank God.  And then, for thirteen years, nobody came. But that wasn’t entirely true. There were field mice and an army of daddy longlegs. There were three bats that flew in through the open attic window, which the family had forgotten to close when they left and which the caretaker had overlooked. The window faced southwest so it deflected the worst of the wind and the rain; it served as an aperture that allowed the house to breathe.  A quartet of mischievous kids broke in through the weak door on the screened-in porch, and for a moment, the house felt optimistic. Humans! Youngsters! But these were trespassers. Though not, thankfully, vandals. They hunted around—finding no food except one can of pork and beans and a cylindrical carton of Quaker oats, rife with weevils (which frightened the girl holding the carton so badly that she dropped it and the oats scattered across the linoleum floor). The kids prodded one another to venture upstairs. Around the island, word was the house was haunted.  Nobody here but me, the house would have said if the house could talk. Well, me and the bats. And the mice. And the spiders!  In one of the bedrooms, the kids found a foot-high sculpture of a man, made from driftwood and shells and beach glass. The man had seaweed hair.  Cool! one of the kids, a boy with red hair and freckles, said. I’m taking this!  That’s stealing, the girl who had dropped the oatmeal said.  The boy set the sculpture down. It’s stupid anyway. Let’s get out of here.  The others agreed. They left, finding nothing more of interest. The toilet didn’t even have water in it.  Again, silence. Emptiness.  Until one day the caretaker used his old key and the front door swung open, groaning on its hinges. It wasn’t the caretaker, but the caretaker’s son, grown up now. He inhaled—the house knew it couldn’t smell terribly good—and patted the door frame with affection.  “They’re coming back,” he said. “They’re coming back.” Plans for the vacation changed, and then changed again.  Back in March, when arrangements for Chess’s wedding were falling into place as neatly as bricks in a garden path, an idea came to Birdie: a week for just the two of them in the house on Tuckernuck Island. As recently as three years earlier, such an idea would have been unthinkable; ever since Chess was a little girl, she and Birdie had clashed. They didn’t “get along.” (Which meant that Chess didn’t get along with Birdie, right? Birdie had tried everything in her power to gain her daughter’s good graces, and yet she was perpetually held in contempt. She said the wrong thing, she did the wrong thing.) But lately, things between mother and daughter had improved—enough for Birdie to suggest a week of bonding in the family cottage before Chess embarked on the rest of her life with Michael Morgan.  Birdie had phoned Chess at work to see if the idea would fly.  “I have to call you back,” Chess said in the tight voice that meant Birdie should have waited and called Chess at home. Chess was the food editor of Glamorous Home magazine. She was the youngest editor on the magazine’s staff; she was the youngest editor working for the Diamond Publishing Group, and she worked extra hard to prove herself. Chess’s job was one Birdie secretly coveted, being an enthusiastic and accomplished at-home gourmet cook. She was so, so proud of Chess, and envious of her, too.  “Okay, honey!” Birdie said. “But just put this in your stew pot: you and me in the house on Tuckernuck the week of Fourth of July.” “You and me?” Chess said. “And who else?” “Just us,” Birdie said.  “The whole week?” Chess said.  “Can you?” Birdie asked. Chess’s job had seasonal flexibility. The summer was slow; the holidays were insanity. “Would you?” “Let me think about it,” Chess said, and she hung up.  Birdie paced her house, agitated and tense. She felt like she had in 1972 when she was waiting to find out if she’d gotten a bid from Alpha Phi. Would Chess consider this trip? If Chess said no, Birdie decided, she wouldn’t take it personally. Chess was busy, and a week was a long time. Would Birdie have wanted to spend a week alone with her own mother? Probably not. Birdie picked up her cup of tea, but it had gone cold. She put it in the microwave to reheat and sat down at her computer, which she kept in the kitchen, where she could get the news and recipes. She checked her e-mail. Her younger daughter, Tate, was a computer wizard and sent Birdie at least one e-mail each day, though it was sometimes a forwarded joke, or a chain letter, which Birdie deleted without reading. Today, her in-box was empty. Birdie chastised herself. Chess would never want to spend a week with her alone. She shouldn’t have asked.  But then, just as she was about to sink into the self-doubt that plagued nearly every interaction with Chess (why was her relationship with her elder daughter so fraught? What had Birdie done wrong?), the phone rang. Birdie snapped it up. It was Chess.  “July first through seventh?” Chess said. “You and me?” “You’ll do it?” Birdie said.  “Absolutely,” Chess said. “It sounds great. Thanks, Bird!” Birdie sighed—relief, happiness, elation! A week on Tuckernuck did sound great. One of the benefits of being divorced now, after three decades of being married, was that Birdie could do whatever she damn well pleased. The house on Tuckernuck had been in the Tate family for seventy-five years—her family, not Grant’s family. Whereas Birdie had grown up with memories of simple, carefree summer days on Tuckernuck, Grant had not. He had pretended to like Tuckernuck for the two summers of their courtship, but once they were married and had children, he revealed his disdain. He loathed the place—the house was too primitive, the generator unreliable. He wasn’t a pioneer; he didn’t want to work a pump by hand for water that was then heated over a fire for his bath. He didn’t like mice or mosquitoes or bats hanging from the rafters. He didn’t like to be without a television or a phone. He was lawyer to half of Wall Street. How could Birdie reasonably expect him to live without a phone?  Grant had suffered through two weeks a summer in the house on Tuckernuck until Tate was a senior in high school, and then he put his foot down: no more.  Birdie hadn’t been to Tuckernuck in thirteen years. It was time she returned.  And so, in addition to planning Chess’s wedding to Michael Morgan, Birdie also planned a week’s vacation on Tuckernuck. She called their caretaker, Chuck Lee. As she dialed the number—long forgotten and yet familiar—she found herself singing with nerves. Chuck’s wife, Eleanor, answered the phone. Birdie had never laid eyes on Eleanor, much less had a conversation with her, though Birdie was aware of Eleanor’s existence and she was sure that Eleanor was aware of hers. Birdie decided not to identify herself to Eleanor now; it would be easier that way.  She said, “I’m looking for Chuck Lee, please. Is he available?” “Not at the moment,” Eleanor said. “May I take a message?” “I have a caretaking question,” Birdie said.” “Chuck doesn’t do caretaking anymore,” Eleanor said. The woman had a pleasant enough demeanor, Birdie thought. In Birdie’s younger imagination, Eleanor had weighed four hundred pounds and had skin the texture of a squid and a faint mustache.  “Oh,” Birdie said. She wondered if Chuck and Eleanor’s phone had caller ID, but decided not. Chuck was a man firmly embedded in 1974 and always had been.  “My son Barrett has taken over the business,” Eleanor said. “Would you like his number?” After Birdie hung up, she had to sit down and take a moment. How mercilessly the years flew by! Birdie had known Barrett Lee all his life. She remembered him at five years old, a towhead in an orange life preserver sitting beside his father on the Boston Whaler that picked up Birdie and Grant and the kids from Madaket Harbor on Nantucket and delivered them to the slice of beach, as white and soft as breadcrumbs, that fronted their property on the tiny neighboring island of Tuckernuck. Was Barrett Lee old enough to take over a business? In age, he had fallen somewhere between Chess and Tate, who were thirty-two and thirty respectively, making Barrett thirty-one or so. And Chuck had retired like a normal sixty-five-year-old man, whereas Grant still rode the train into the city every morning and, for all Birdie knew, still took clients to Gallagher’s for martinis and sirloins after work.  Birdie called Barrett Lee’s cell phone, and sure enough, a man answered.  “Barrett?” Birdie said. “This is Birdie Cousins calling. I own the Tate house on Tuckernuck?” “Hey, Mrs. Cousins,” Barrett Lee said casually, as though they had spoken only the week before. “How’s it going?” Birdie tried to remember the last time she had seen Barrett Lee. She had a vague memory of him as a teenager. He had been quite handsome, like his father. He played football for the Nantucket Whalers; he had broad shoulders and that white-blond hair. He had come out on his father’s boat alone early one morning to take one of the girls fishing. And then another time he had taken one of the girls on a picnic lunch. For the life of her, Birdie couldn’t remember if he had taken Chess or Tate.  How’s it going? How was she supposed to answer that? Grant and I divorced two years ago. He lives in a “loft” apartment in Norwalk and dates women he calls “cougars,” while I bounce off the walls of the family homestead in New Canaan, six thousand square feet filled with rugs and antiques and framed photographs documenting a life now gone. I cook an elaborate meal on Monday and eat it all week long. I still belong to the garden club. I go to a book group once a month and frequently I’m the only one who’s read the selection; the rest of the women are just there for the wine and the gossip. Chess and Tate are grown up, with lives of their own. I wish I had a job. I spend more time than I should feeling angry at Grant for never encouraging me to work outside the home. Because now, here I am, fifty-seven years old, divorced, becoming the kind of woman who inflicts herself on her children.  “It goes well,” Birdie said. “I’m sure hearing from me is something of a shock.” “A shock,” Barrett confirmed.  “How is your father?” Birdie asked. “He’s retired?” “Retired,” Barrett said. “He had a stroke just before Thanksgiving. He’s fine, but it slowed him way down.” “I’m sorry to hear that,” Birdie said. This also gave her pause. Chuck Lee had had a stroke? Chuck Lee with his military buzz cut, and the cigarette clenched in the corner of his mouth, and his biceps bulging as he pulled the ropes of the anchor off the ocean floor? He was slow moving now? Birdie imagined a land turtle, bald and lumbering, then quickly erased it from her mind. “Listen, Chess and I are going to spend the week of the Fourth of July in the house. Can you get it ready?” “Well,” Barrett said.  “Well, what?” “It’s going to need work,” Barrett said. “I stopped by there back in September and the place is falling down on itself. It needs to be reshingled and it probably needs a new roof. You’ll need a new generator. And the stairs down to the beach have rotted. Now, I didn’t go inside, but…” “Can you take care of it?” Birdie asked. “I want it to be usable. Can you buy a good generator and fix the rest of the house up? I’ll send a check tomorrow. Five thousand? Ten thousand?” In the divorce, Birdie had gotten the house and a generous monthly stipend. Grant had also promised that if she had larger expenses, he would cover them, as long as he deemed them “reasonable.” Grant hated the Tuckernuck house; Birdie had no idea if he would deem the cost of fixing it up reasonable or not. She smelled a possible battleground, but she couldn’t let the Tuckernuck house fall to pieces after seventy-five years, could she?  “Ten thousand to start,” Barrett said. “I’m sorry to tell you that…” “No, don’t be sorry. It’s not your fault…” “But if you want the house back to where it was…” “We have no choice!” Birdie said. “It was my grandmother’s house.” “You’d like it ready by July first?” “July first,” Birdie said. “It’s just going to be Chess and me for one last hurrah. She’s getting married in September.” “Married?” Barrett said. He paused, and Birdie realized that it must have been Chess that he’d taken on the picnic.  “On September twenty-fifth,” Birdie said proudly.  “Wow,” Barrett said.” By the middle of April, tax time, every last detail of Chess’s wedding to Michael Morgan had been tended to—including the dress for the flower girl, the catering menu, and the selection of hymns at the church. Birdie called Chess at work much more frequently to get her opinion and her approval. Most of the time what Chess said was, “Yes, Birdie, fine. Whatever you think.” Birdie had been both surprised and flattered when Chess had asked her for help with the wedding. She had essentially dropped the thing in Birdie’s lap, saying matter-of-factly, “You have exquisite taste.” Birdie happened to believe this was true; her good taste was a fact, like her green eyes or her attached earlobes. But to have Chess’s confidence was gratifying.  Three hundred people would be invited to the wedding; the service would be held at Trinity Episcopal, with Benjamin Denton, the pastor of Chess’s youth, presiding. The ceremony would be followed by a tented reception in Birdie’s backyard. The landscapers had started working the previous September. The pièce de résistance, in Birdie’s opinion, was a floating island that would be placed in Birdie’s pond, where the couple would take their first dance.  Grant had called only once to complain about cost, and that was in regard to the twenty thousand dollars for the engineering and manufacturing of the floating island. Birdie had patiently explained the concept to him over the phone, but he either didn’t get it or didn’t like it.  “Are we or are we not paying for a regular dance floor?” “We are,” Birdie said. “This is a special thing, for the first dances. Chess dancing with Michael, Chess dancing with you, you dancing with me.” “Me dancing with you?” Birdie cleared her throat. “Emily Post says that if neither of the divorced spouses is remarried, then… yes, Grant, you’re going to have to dance with me. Sorry about that.” “Twenty thousand dollars is a lot of money, Bird.” It took a phone call from Chess to convince him. God only knows what she said, but Grant wrote the check.” At the end of April, Birdie went on her first date since the divorce. The date had been set up by Birdie’s sister, India, who was a curator at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Center City, Philadelphia. India had been married to the sculptor Bill Bishop and had raised three sons while Bill traveled the globe, gaining notoriety. In 1995, Bill shot himself in the head in a hotel in Bangkok, and the suicide had devastated India. For a while there, Birdie had feared India wouldn’t recover. She would end up as a bag lady in Rittenhouse Square, or as a recluse, keeping cats and polishing Bill’s portrait in its frame. But India had somehow risen from the ashes, putting her master’s degree in art history to use and becoming a curator. Unlike Birdie, India was cutting edge and chic. She wore Catherine Malandrino dresses, four-inch heels, and Bill Bishop’s reading glasses on a chain around her neck. India dated all kinds of men—older men, younger men, married men—and the man she set Birdie up with was one of her castoffs. He was too old. How old was too old? Sixty-five, which was Grant’s age.  His name was Hank Dunlap. Hank was the retired headmaster of an elite private school in Manhattan. His wife, Caroline, was independently wealthy. The wife sat on the board of trustees at the Guggenheim Museum; India had met Hank and Caroline at a Guggenheim benefit years earlier.  “What happened to Caroline?” Birdie asked. “Did they get divorced? Did she die?” “Neither,” India said. “She has Alzheimer’s. She’s in a facility upstate.” “So the wife is still alive, they’re still married, and you dated him? And now you want me to date him?” “Get over yourself, Bird,” India said. “His wife is in another world and won’t be coming back. He wants companionship. He is exactly your type.” “He is?” Birdie said. What was her “type”? Someone like Grant? Grant was the devil’s attorney. He was all about single-malt whiskey and expensive cars with leather interiors. He was not the kindly headmaster type, content with a salary in the low six figures. “Does he golf?” “No.” “Ah, then he is my type.” Birdie swore she would never again be romantically involved with a golfer.  “He’s cute,” India said, like they were talking about some sixteen-year-old. “You’ll like him.” Surprise! Birdie liked him. She had decided to forgo all of the “I can’t believe I’m dating again at my age” worrywart nonsense and just be a realist. She was dating again at her age, but instead of fretting, she got showered and dressed and made up as she would have if she and Grant were going to the theater or to the country club with the Campbells. She wore a simple wrap dress and heels and some good jewelry, including her diamond engagement ring (it had been her grandmother’s and would someday go to one of her grandchildren). Birdie sat on her garden bench in the mild spring evening with a glass of Sancerre and Mozart playing on the outdoor speakers as she waited for old Hank to show up.  Her heartbeat seemed regular.  She heard a car in the driveway and proceeded inside, where she rinsed her wineglass, checked her lipstick in the mirror, and fetched her spring coat. With a deep breath, she opened the door. And there stood old Hank, holding a bouquet of fragrant purple hyacinths. He had salt-and-pepper hair and wore rimless glasses.  He was, as India had promised, cute. Very cute. When he saw Birdie, he smiled widely. He grinned. He was darling.  “You’re even prettier than your sister!” he said.  Birdie swooned. “God,” she said. “I love you already.” And they laughed.
