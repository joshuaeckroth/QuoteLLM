Good to the Last Drop 
The Quicker Picker Upper
Think outside the bun
The Uncola
Nothing runs like a Deere 
We try harder – Avis. Adopted in 1962, the campaign spoke to the fact that Avis was the second biggest car rental company, and as a result, needed to try harder.
Snap Crackle Pop!
I want my MTV 
Finger-Lickin’ Good 
Think small 
There’s always room for Jell-O 
Because you’re worth it 
The ultimate driving machine 
The Few. The Proud. The Marines.
When you care enough to send the very best 
I’m Lovin’ it 
Just Do It
Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don’t
Coke is it!
You’re in good hands with Allstate
Betcha can’t eat just one
Have it Your Way
You can’t top the copper top
Be all that you can be 
A little dab’ll do ya! 
Tastes so good, cats ask for it by name 
With a name like Smuckers it has to be good 
Nothing outlasts the Energizer. It keeps going and going. 
You deserve a break today 
America runs on Dunkin 
Plop Plop, Fizz Fizz. Oh, what a relief it is 
Unleash a Jaguar 
Oh, what a feeling! 
Merrill Lynch is bullish on America 
Look, Ma, no cavities! 
Reach out and touch someone 
When it absolutely, positively, has to be there overnight.
There are some things money can’t buy. For everything else, there’s MasterCard 
Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
A Diamond is Forever
Do the Dew
Eat Mor Chikin!
Obey your thirst
M’mm! M’mm! Good!
Fly the friendly skies
It’s everywhere you want to be
Does she or doesn’t she?
Expect More Pay Less 
Please don’t squeeze the Charmin 
It’s Miller Time
Don’t leave home without it 
Every Kiss begins with Kay 
What would you do for Klondike Bar? 
Be Your Way 
Have it Your Way 
You’re the Boss
The fire’s ready
Your way, right away
Fast Food for Fast Times
We do it like you do it
It takes two hands to hold a Whopper
Wake up with the King
Burger King, Home of the Whopper
We Have the Meats
Arby’s. Now That Your Tastes Have Grown Up!
What are you eating today?
It’s Good Mood Food
Fresh. Smooth. Real. It’s all here.
Be yourself and make it a Bud Light
Make it a Bud Light
Everything else is just a light
Wassup?
Save Money. Live Better.
Always Low Prices
Just Do It
Yesterday you said tomorrow
Be Legendary
I run like a girl. Keep up.
Test Your Faith Daily
Make Yourself Unstoppable
Don’t run away from challenges. Run over them.
Think training is hard. Try losing.
Taking it easy won’t take you anywhere
Leave nothing
Obsessed is a word the lazy use to describe dedicated
Work hard. Dream big.
Ran sounds better than run
There is no finish line
Run more than your mouth
Impossible is Nothing
Adidas is all in
Conquer the Concrete
Believe in 5ive

Just for the taste of it, Diet Coke. 
See the USA in your Chevrolet. 
Nobody doesn’t like Sara Lee. 
Nothing says lovin’ like somethin’ from the oven. 
What would you do for a Klondike Bar? 
Winston tastes good like a cigarette should. 
If you’ve got the time, we’ve got the beer. 
You’ll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent.

I run like a girl. Keep up.
Test Your Faith Daily
Make Yourself Unstoppable
Don’t run away from challenges. Run over them.
Think training is hard. Try losing.
Taking it easy won’t take you anywhere
Leave nothing
Obsessed is a word the lazy use to describe dedicated

Ran sounds better than run
There is no finish line
Run more than your mouth
Impossible is Nothing
Adidas is all in
Conquer the Concrete

Nothing says lovin’ like somethin’ from the oven. 
What would you do for a Klondike Bar? 
Winston tastes good like a cigarette should. 
If you’ve got the time, we’ve got the beer. 
You’ll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent. 
Here’s to good friends. 
Rice-a-Roni, the San Francisco treat.
