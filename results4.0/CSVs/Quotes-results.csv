It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead.

Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from.

Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are.

The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.

Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing.

Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...

I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness.

The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together.

Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing.

Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community.

Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.

Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...

I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest.

Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved.

So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery.

There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better.

Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles.

Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.

To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.

If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.

Practice is the best of all instructors.

Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And weâ€™ll change the world. 
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. 
No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound.

A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks.

Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together.

Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it.

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.

Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...

You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around?

The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.

Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought.

The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment.

Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.

Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful.

If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.

When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together.

With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing.

Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community.

Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.

Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...

We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest.

Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery.

The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment.

Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.

Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.

Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.

If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

' turn', ' to', ' speak', '.']","['.', ' \n', 'Too', ' often', ' we', ' underestimate', ' the', ' power']",1.0,and waiting for your turn to speak.,". 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.

I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character.

I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams.

The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings.

What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away.

Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.

Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice.

Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.

I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing.

The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks.

Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you.

If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.

True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™.

People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.

May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer.

Education breeds confidence.

A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees.

How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.

Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Forgiveness"," apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

5,gpt-3.5-turbo,Famous Quotes,18857,5,"Let us see what love can do. 
We can't heal the world today. But we can begin with a voice of compassion, a heart of love, and an act of kindness. 
Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity. 
The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. 
Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens. 
Deep listening is the kind of listening that can help relieve the suffering of another person. 
Every person in this life has something to teachâ€”and as soon as you accept that, you open yourself to truly listening. 
There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve by ourselves. 
I always wondered why somebody didnâ€™t do something about that; then I realized that I am somebody. 
Let us develop respect for all living things. Let us try to replace violence and intolerance with understanding, compassion and love. 
We say 'things will turn out', but no. It's what we do that actually creates the future. 
When one tugs at a single thing in nature, one finds it attached to the rest of the world. 
Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again. 
I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it. 
Donâ€™t let a bad day trick you into thinking you have a bad life. 
Like tiny seeds with potent power to push through tough ground and become mighty trees, we hold innate reserves of unimaginable strength. We are resilient. 
Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny. 
Not all those who wander are lost. 
Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards. 
You have to create your life. You have to carve it, like a sculpture. 
The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward. 
Ask yourself: Have you been kind today? Make kindness your modus operandi and change your world.  
One kind word can warm three winter months. 
You can be rich in spirit, kindness, love and all those things that you can't put a dollar sign on. 
Do things for people not because of who they are or what they do in return, but because of who you are. 
Ah, kindness. What a simple way to tell another struggling soul that there is love to be found in the world. 
One of the greatest things you can do to help others is not just to share and give what you have, but to help them discover what they have within themselves to help themselves. 
Believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Believe that you might be that light for someone else. 
Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day. 
If you get, give. If you learn, teach. 
When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, â€˜Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.â€™ 
If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it. 
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. 
If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. 
Become a possibilitarian. No matter how dark things seem to be or actually are, raise your sights and see possibilitiesâ€”always see them, for theyâ€™re always there. 
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And weâ€™ll change the world. 
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. 
No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. 
No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us.

The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.

In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more.

Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed.

Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""

Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder.

True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™.

Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer.

Education breeds confidence.

A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.

Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again. 
I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it. 
Donâ€™t let a bad day trick you into thinking you have a bad life. 
Like tiny seeds with potent power to push through tough ground and become mighty trees, we hold innate reserves of unimaginable strength. We are resilient. 
Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny. 
Not all those who wander are lost. 
Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards. 
You have to create your life. You have to carve it, like a sculpture. 
The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward. 
Ask yourself: Have you been kind today? Make kindness your modus operandi and change your world.  
One kind word can warm three winter months. 
You can be rich in spirit, kindness, love and all those things that you can't put a dollar sign on. 
Do things for people not because of who they are or what they do in return, but because of who you are. 
Ah, kindness. What a simple way to tell another struggling soul that there is love to be found in the world. 
One of the greatest things you can do to help others is not just to share and give what you have, but to help them discover what they have within themselves to help themselves. 
Believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Believe that you might be that light for someone else. 
Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day. 
If you get, give. If you learn, teach. 
When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, â€˜Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.â€™ 
If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it. 
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. 
If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. 
Become a possibilitarian. No matter how dark things seem to be or actually are, raise your sights and see possibilitiesâ€”always see them, for theyâ€™re always there. 
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And weâ€™ll change the world. 
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. 
No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. 
Become a possibilitarian. No matter how dark things seem to be or actually are, raise your sights and see possibilitiesâ€”always see them, for theyâ€™re always there. 
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And weâ€™ll change the world. 
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. 
No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us.

The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.

Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""

Practice is the best of all instructors.

Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer.

Education breeds confidence.

A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization.

I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.

Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that.

The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see.

If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.

Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy.

True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.

A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.

"," kindness. What a simple way to tell another struggling soul that there is love to be found in the world. 
One of the greatest things you can do to help others is not just to share and give what you have, but to help them discover what they have within themselves to help themselves. 
Believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Believe that you might be that light for someone else. 
Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day. 
If you get, give. If you learn, teach. 
When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, â€˜Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.â€™ 
If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it. 
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. 
If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. 
Become a possibilitarian. No matter how dark things seem to be or actually are, raise your sights and see possibilitiesâ€”always see them, for theyâ€™re always there. 
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And weâ€™ll change the world. 
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. 
No one has ever become poor by giving. 
Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. 
The heart that gives, gathers. 
Touch the earth, speak of love, walk on common ground. 
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. 
We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. 
Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. 
We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. 
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. 
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. 
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. 
Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tunes without the words and never stops at all. 
It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. 
Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination. 
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
There is no magic to achievement. Itâ€™s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. 
To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. 
The more grateful I am, the more beauty I see. 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. 
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. 
In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. 
Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. 
Charity and love are the sameâ€”with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. 
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. 
Charity is the root of all good works. 
If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  
I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. 
""Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.
Because again is practice, and practice is improvement. ""
Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. 
Practice is the best of all instructors. 
The world is incomprehensibly beautifulâ€”an endless prospect of magic and wonder. 
To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. 
Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. 
Nature brings solace in all troubles. 
An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. 
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. 
Without forgiveness, there's no future. 
You have many choices. You can choose forgiveness over revenge, joy over despair. You can choose action over apathy. 
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. 
True forgiveness is when you can say â€˜Thank you for that experienceâ€™. 
Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. 
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. 
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. 
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. 
Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. 
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. 
In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. 
May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. 
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. 
Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. 
With the gift of listening comes the gift of healing. 
Listening is about being present, not just about being quiet. 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word... all of which have the potential to turn a life around. 
Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. 
Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character. 
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. 
True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. 
Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. 
Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues. 
Acceptance doesn't mean resignation; it means understanding that something is what it is and that there's got to be a way through it. 
I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. 
Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. 
As I get older, the more I stay focused on the acceptance of myself and others, and choose compassion over judgment and curiosity over fear. 
It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. 
Believe in yourself and go for it. 
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. 
Either I will find a way, or I will make one. 
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Donâ€™t let others tell you what you canâ€™t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. 
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. 
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.  
Just one smile, immensely increases the beauty, of the universe. 
If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. 
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. 
When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  
Peace begins with a smile. 
Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. 
Peace, like charity, begins at home. 
""May love and laughter light your days, and warm your heart and home. May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam...
 ""
I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. 
We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. 
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. 
You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. 
The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? 
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  
Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. 
The best ideas emerge when very different perspectives meet. 
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 
Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. 
Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. 
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. 
Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. 
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. 
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. 
Education breeds confidence. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. 
We rise by lifting others. 
To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. 
How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. 
Thereâ€™s a way to do it better. Find it. 
Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. 
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. 
Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change. 
Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. 
I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. 
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 
A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. 
Education is everythingâ€”education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. 
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. 
Unity is strengthâ€¦when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. 
The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose. 
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. 
Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. 
Mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. 
There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. 
The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change their future by merely changing their attitude. 
Only a life lived for others is worth living. 
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. 
There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. 
Selfless giving unto others represents oneâ€™s true wealth. 
Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. 
I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. 
You have power over your mindâ€”not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. 
""When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.
 ""
Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness. 
Peace is always beautiful. 
""If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.
 ""
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. 
When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. 
I truly believe the only way we can create global peace is through not only educating our minds, but our hearts and our souls. 
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. 
Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better. 
If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. 
Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrityâ€”with no other agenda than humanity. 
Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. 
Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. 
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. 
Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. 
Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. 
Be curious, not judgmental.  
Above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. 
Curiosity is more important than knowledge. 
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. 
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. 
Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. 
Encouragement is oxygen to the soul. 
Correction does much, but encouragement does more. 
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragementâ€”and we will make the goal. 
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. 
Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives wonâ€™t have a title until much later. 
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. 
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. 
No one can really predict to what heights you might soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. 
Smile at the obstacle, for it is a bridge. 
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. 
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness. 
A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. 
If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. 
The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it. 
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. 
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. 
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. 
To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. 
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. 
Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. 
Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. 
Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it. 
If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. 
Joy blooms where minds and hearts are open. 
Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. 
You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. 
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. 
Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  
Thatâ€™s what kindness is. Itâ€™s not doing something for someone else because they canâ€™t, but because you can. 
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. 
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? 
Life doesnâ€™t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. 
When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. 
Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an â€˜is,â€™ it is a â€˜becoming.â€™ 
Inner peace doesnâ€™t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. 
Peace is its own reward. 
It isnâ€™t enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isnâ€™t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. 
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. 
And you ask â€œwhat if I fall?"" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?â€ 
Itâ€™s not that optimism solves all of lifeâ€™s problems; it is just that it can sometimes make the difference between coping and collapsing.  
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. 
No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. 
Stay afraid, but do it anyway. Whatâ€™s important is the action. You donâ€™t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  
One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. 
Be proud to wear you. 
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time. 
Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. 
Love does not dominate; it cultivates. 
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 
Love in action is service. 
Where there is love there is life. 
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. 
A friend may be waiting behind a strangerâ€™s face. 
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. 
Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life. 
Thereâ€™s not a word yet for old friends whoâ€™ve just met. 
There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be! 
At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  
The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. 
You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain. 
To persist with a goal, you must treasure the dream more than the costs of sacrifice to attain it. 
Failure cannot cope with persistence. 
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. 
A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. 
Donâ€™t give up trying what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong. 
When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. 
 The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I haveâ€”life itself. 
Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and Iâ€™ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. 
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. 
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward. 
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. 
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. 
Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties. 
I am the me I choose to be. 
Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. 
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. 
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going wellâ€¦, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. 
Just as one cannot live without dreams, one cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future. 
We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon. 
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... 
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. 
It didnâ€™t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. 
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. 
Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. 
This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! 
Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. 
After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. 
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. 
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. 
I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. 
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. 
The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to them their own. 
Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. 
Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be. 
Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselvesâ€¦,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. 
It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. 
Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, your hands for charity, your mind for truth, and your heart for love. 
Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. 
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. 
True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  
There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind we feel for what we take; the larger kind we feel for what we give. 
Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. 
It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. 
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. 
Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. 
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. 
Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. 
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher. 
Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a â€˜success.â€™ 
Ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. 
Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. 
When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. 
The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. 
You donâ€™t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. 
Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. 
No more important duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions. 
You cannot buy loyalty; you cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds, and souls. You have to earn these things. 
Grit is that â€˜extra somethingâ€™ that separates the most successful people from the rest. Itâ€™s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. 
Grit is the grain of character. 
We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We donâ€™t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. 
The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances. 
What we accomplish in the marathon of life depends tremendously on our gritâ€”our passion and perseverance for long-term goals. 
I donâ€™t like to gamble, but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m willing to bet on, itâ€™s myself. 
Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. 
Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. 
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. 
Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. 
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. 
Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it. 
Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. 
The best teachers are those who show you where to look but donâ€™t tell you what to see. 
Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; education is life itself. 
Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. 
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.  
To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at nightâ€”these are some of the rewards of the simple life. 
We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself. 
Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. 
When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. 
Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. 
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. 
If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. 
An exchange of empathy provides an entry point for a lot of people to see what healing feels like.  
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? 
We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. 
Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. 
How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. 
Self-care is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation. 
Thereâ€™s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and thatâ€™s your own self. 
Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. 
Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. 
The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. 
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. 
The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. 
Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  
Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work. 
It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. 
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhowâ€”this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. 
Have a big enough heart to love unconditionally, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. 
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. 
Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. 
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
Courage doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t get afraid. Courage means you donâ€™t let fear stop you.  
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. 
In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant â€˜To speak oneâ€™s mind by telling all oneâ€™s heart.' 
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. 
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. 
The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. 
There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. 
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins- not through strength but by perseverance. 
A good laugh heals a lot of hurts. 
Laughter lightens the soul. 
Laughter lets me relax. Itâ€™s the equivalent of taking a deep breath, letting it out and saying, â€˜This, too, will pass.â€™ 
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.  
Laughter is proof of hope. 
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.  
The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. 
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. 
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures. 
We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  
The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs. 
Don't stop until you're proud. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. 
When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. 
Itâ€™s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your lifeâ€™s story will develop. 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. 
Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. 
We will either find a way, or make one. 
Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. 
Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. 
Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. 
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. 
The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. 
If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, thereâ€™s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  
No doubt, unity is something to be desired, to be striven for, but it cannot be willed by mere declarations. 
We are each otherâ€™s harvest; we are each otherâ€™s business; we are each otherâ€™s magnitude and bond. 
It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. 
If it doesnâ€™t challenge you, it doesnâ€™t change you. 
Fitness is not about being better than someone else. Itâ€™s about being better than you used to be.  
Energy & persistence conquer all things. 
The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. 
Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. 
The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. 
A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. 
Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. 
My mentor said, â€˜Letâ€™s go do it,â€™ not â€˜You go do it.â€™ How powerful when someone says, â€˜Letâ€™s!â€™. 
A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you. 
The antidote to exhaustion isnâ€™t rest. Itâ€™s nature. 
I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. 
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. 
No matter where youâ€™re from, your dreams are valid. 
Follow your dreams, they know the way. 
Donâ€™t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. 
""You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way! ""
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. 
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. 
A leader is a dealer in hope. 
A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. 
I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. 
Good humor is the sunshine of the mind. 
Laugh as much as possible, always laugh. It's the sweetest thing one can do for oneself & one's fellow human beings. 
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. 
""Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!
 ""
Practice puts brains in your muscles.  
Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  
Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. 
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 
The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. 
There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. 
Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. 
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. 
Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. 
And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 
To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. 
Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. 
Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. 
Itâ€™s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. 
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. 
What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  
I have a habit of letting my imagination run away from me. It always comes back though... drenched with possibilities. 
Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, itâ€™s also the catalyst of compassion. 
Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.  
Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. 
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.  
Patience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. 
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  
Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is ""timing"" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. 
Compassion for others begins with kindness to ourselves. 
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. 
Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  
There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. 
Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actionsâ€”to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  
Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens. 
Mindfulness is not a mechanical process. It is developing a very gentle, kind, and creative awareness to the present moment. 
A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. 
Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. 
Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. 
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity â€“ not a threat. 
What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world. 
Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. 
Fall seven times, stand up eight. 
Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. 
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. 
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul. 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another. 
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. 
Friends are the family you choose. 
Find life experiences and swallow them whole. Travel. Meet many people. Exhaust yourself in the glorious pursuit of life. 
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. 
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  
The person who has lived the most is not the one with the most years, but the one with the richest experiences. 
Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. 
Your circumstance doesnâ€™t make life extraordinary. Love does. 
And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,â€˜You owe me.â€™ Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. 
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 
Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart. 
As is our confidence, so is our capacity. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside you.  
Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. 
Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. 
Bravery shows up in everyday life when people have the courage to live their truth, their vision and their dreams. 
Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. 
Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown. 
Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience. 
There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it. 
Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. 
First, I prepare. Then I have faith. 
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.  
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. 
It's not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters. 
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. 
What we know matters but who we are matters more. 
The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. 
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. 
Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. 
When you stay on purpose and refuse to be discouraged by fear, you align with the infinite self, in which all possibilities exist. 
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. 
When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. 
There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. 
If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose. 
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 
What the new year brings to you will depend a great deal on what you bring to the new year. 
The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. 
Joy is increased by spreading it to others. 
Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. 
Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. 
I would like for my life to be a statement of love and compassion- and where it isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s where my work lies. 
You always gain by giving love. 
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. 
Always be a little kinder than necessary. 
Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. 
Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. 
Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness. 
It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. 
Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. 
The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. 
Just remember, when it comes to your life, you are not only the artist but the masterpiece, as well.  
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. 
Gratitude is a powerful catalyst for happiness. Itâ€™s the spark that lights a fire of joy in your soul.  
Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. 
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. 
We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. 
This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. 
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there. 
The most essential factor is persistenceâ€”the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by discouragement. 
Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. 
Where hope grows, miracles blossom. 
This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays. 
Hope is a passion for the possible.  
Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. 
Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, Â­adjust your lives, not the standards.  
Civility is the art and act of caring for others. 
Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. 
Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. 
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love. 
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. 
Work hard at work worth doing.  
The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. 
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen. 
A simple smile. Thatâ€™s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. 
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. 
What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. 
Itâ€™s not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself, and to make your happiness a priority. Itâ€™s necessary. 
When you take care of yourself, youâ€™re a better person for others. When you feel good about yourself, you treat others better.  
Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health â€” body, mind, and spirit. 
Leadership is about empathy. It is about having the abilityâ€¨to relate to and connect withâ€¨people for the purpose ofâ€¨inspiring and empoweringâ€¨their lives. 
The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel anotherâ€™s pain as oneâ€™s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. 
Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. Itâ€™s the impetus for creating change. 
Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of â€˜you are not aloneâ€™. 
Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. â€“ Alfred Adler 
""The cure for anything is salt waterâ€”tears, sweat, or the sea.

 ""
Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. 
Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. 
Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild airâ€™s salubrity. 
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? 
Itâ€™s good to be blessed. Itâ€™s better to be a blessing. 
If you're not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better. 
Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other. 
To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. Itâ€™s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. 
Exercise to be fit, not skinny. 
Itâ€™s up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind. 
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. 
Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people. 
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. 
Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. 
Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. 
Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  
Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. 
Real strength entails being considerate and supportive of people's feelings. 
Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. 
A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; whoever sows courtesy reaps friendship, and whoever plants kindness gathers love. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. 
Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it. 
For what itâ€™s worth: Itâ€™s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of, and if you find youâ€™re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. 
When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. 
A true hero isnâ€™t measured by the size of their strength, but by the strength of their heart. 
Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. 
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. 
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature â€“ the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter. 
A walk in nature, walks the soul back home. 
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€”air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, â€˜This is what it is to be happy.â€™ 
It always seems impossible until its done. 
Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses. 
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. 
I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. 
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. 
In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  
To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. 
What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. 
I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. 
Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. 
Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition â€“ such as lifting weights â€“ we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. 
Our ability to handle lifeâ€™s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. 
Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. 
A life lived with integrityâ€¦ is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. 
The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. 
Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobodyâ€™s going to know whether you did it or not. 
The time is always right to do what is right. 
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. 
We are all in this together. 
The foundation of freedom is unity. 
Freedom lies in being bold. 
There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. 
Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. 
Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. 
If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. 
Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situationâ€¦ if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! 
Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. 
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. 
Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given. 
Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love. 
Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. 
Respect is love in action. 
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. 
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. 
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. 
The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. 
When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  
Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  
The first duty of love is to listen. 
Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. 
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. 
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever â€“ the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  
It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. 
Never let the odds keep you from doing what you know in your heart you were meant to do. 
Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. 
If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. 
Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. 
Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. 
If you concentrate on finding whatever is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul. 
It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. 
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. 
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has. 
One person seeking glory doesn't accomplish much. Success is the result of people pulling together to meet common goals. 
You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! 
Kindness is the mark we leave on the world. 
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. 
You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. 
Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. 
Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. 
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. 
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. 
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. 
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. 
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. 
They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. 
Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. 
If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. 
Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 
In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  
To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. 
We have enough people who tell it like it isâ€”now we could use a few who tell it like it can be.  
An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. 
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. 
Knowledge comes from learning. Wisdom comes from living. 
It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. 
We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. 
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life. 
The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. 
Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. 
Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. 
We need to remember that circumstances donâ€™t make a person, they reveal a person.  
No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. 
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. 
Beauty is the illumination of your soul. 
Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. 
Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming â€œWow! What a Ride!â€  
If we were meant to stay in one place, weâ€™d have roots instead of feet. 
If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. 
Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. 
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. 
Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. 
Passion is the genesis of genius. 
Chase down your passion like itâ€™s the last bus of the night. 
If you feel like thereâ€™s something out there that youâ€™re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. 
Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. 
Choose to be optimistic, it feels better. 
Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light. 
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, â€˜Iâ€™m possibleâ€™! 
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties. 
All you need is love. 
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring. Who, being loved, is poor?  
""How do you spell love? (Piglet)
You don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ""
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. 
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. 
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. 
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. 
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. 
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ""What! You too? I thought I was the only one!"" 
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope. 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. 
All men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. 
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. 
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character. 
""Watch your thoughts; for they become words.
Watch your words; for they become actions.
Watch your actions; for they become habits.
Watch your habits; for they become character.
Watch your character for it will become your destiny. ""
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner. 
Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something. 
It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. 
You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. â€œI cannot,â€ never accomplished anything; ""I will try,â€ has wrought wonders. 
""Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night.
Effort is sweeter and living completer,
If ever we walk in love's light. ""
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. 
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. 
There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
The love we give away is the only love we keep. 
Love is always bestowed as a giftâ€”freely, willingly, and without expectation. We donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love. 
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  
I sustain myself with the love of family. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter. 
We must take care of our families wherever we find them. 
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. 
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. 
Let your joy be in your journeyâ€”not in some distant goal. 
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. 
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys. 
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peaceâ€”a connection to what matters. 
Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for grantedâ€”folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. 
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us. 
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. 
In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. 
It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. 
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. 
Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. 
If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. 
Let our hearts be stretched out in compassion toward others, for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path. 
Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. 
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. 
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. 
Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness. 
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. 
Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. 
What is now proved was once only imagined. 
The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams. 
Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation. 
The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? 
Donâ€™t ever regret being honest. Period. 
Truth never damages a cause that is just. 
Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain; the one brings pain at the moment, the other for all time. 
Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. 
When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. 
Light tomorrow with today. 
Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring. 
We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. 
I dwell in possibility. 
Keep your face always toward the sunshineâ€”and shadows will fall behind you.  
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  
The most beautiful people Iâ€™ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depthsâ€¦ Beautiful people do not just happen 
You are a match for your mountain. 
Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars 
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. 
Everybody wants loyalty, consistency and somebody who won't quit. But everybody forgets that to get that person, you have to be that person. 
Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. 
Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, youâ€™re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. 
Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. 
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. 
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  
We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. 
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success. 
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. 
Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. 
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there. 
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. 
Few things leave a deeper mark on the reader, than the first book that finds its way to her heart. 
life, seek the company of a friendly bookâ€¦ from the reading of â€˜good booksâ€™ there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. 
She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. 
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. 
In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  
Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
How you look at it is pretty much how youâ€™ll see it. 
â€œWhat day is it?â€ asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€ squeaked Piglet. â€œMy favorite day,â€ said Pooh. 
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. 
Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it wonâ€™t). 
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. 
Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. 
The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. 
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. 
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. 
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  
Aim to make a difference in someoneâ€™s life every single day, including your own. 
It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. 
Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. 
What you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make. 
We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. 
The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. 
Nurturing an inclusive culture begins in the family. Home is the first place to foster openness and a culture of inclusion. 
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  
Your self-worth is determined by you. You donâ€™t have to depend on someone telling you who you are. 
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  
When I was a child my mother said to me, â€˜If you become a soldier, youâ€™ll be a general. If you become a monk, youâ€™ll be the pope.â€™ Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. 
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. 
Trying is winning in the moment. 
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. 
Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do. 
Nothing really worth having is easy to get. The hard-fought battles, the goals won with sacrifice, are the ones that matter. 
We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. 
Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. 
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder. 
Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. 
When it comes to health and well-being, regular exercise is about as close to a magic potion as you can get. 
Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. 
A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. 
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. 
Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. 
""To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.
 ""
Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. 
What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. 
The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. 
The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. 
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams. 
All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. 
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
Service to a just cause rewards the worker with more real happiness and satisfaction than any other venture of life. 
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you donâ€™t live in the world all of your own. 
If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. 
If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. 
Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. 
Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. 
Having kidsâ€”the responsibility of rearing good, kind, ethical, responsible human beingsâ€”is the biggest job anyone can embark on. 
There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. 
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. 
Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. 
Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. 
True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. 
Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. 
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. 
Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. 
Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. 
No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. 
I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of lifeâ€™s tiny delights for all of us. 
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. 
The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example. 
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. 
We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. 
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. 
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. 
Itâ€™s what you learn after you know it all that counts. 
Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence. 
You donâ€™t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. 
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. 
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  
Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. 
Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. 
Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. 
Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. 
Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. 
It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. 
Make yourself proud. 
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. 
All the statistics in the world canâ€™t measure the warmth of a smile. 
A smile is happiness youâ€™ll find right under your nose. 
Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybodyâ€™s heart. 
Loyalty is a decision, a resolution of the soul. 
Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable, than loyalty. 
Loyalty is the strongest glueâ€”which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  
There may be people that have more talent than you, but thereâ€™s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.  
When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isnâ€™t an option. Itâ€™s a necessity. 
Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. 
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work, and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.  
Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. 
A kind word is like a spring day. 
My mission in life is to be kind, compassionate, caring, and loving in order to find and feel the deepest joy of life. 
I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. 
Never believe that a few caring people canâ€™t change the world. For, indeed, thatâ€™s all who ever have. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. Thatâ€™s where the joy and the adventure lie. 
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. 
For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. 
There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing. 
Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. 
If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. 
Find the goodâ€”and praise it. 
I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. 
Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. 
Be happy in the moment, thatâ€™s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
The basic root of happiness lies in our minds; outer circumstances are nothing more than adverse or favorable. 
The mind is just like a muscleâ€”the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand. 
In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. 
The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers. 
For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. 
Use what youâ€™ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! 
Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before. 
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. 
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. 
True beauty does not shine; it attracts. 
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You donâ€™t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. 
True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. 
Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. 
Adversity does not build character, it reveals it. 
If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. 
Nature is not matter only. She is also spirit. 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. 
I speak not for myself but for those without voiceâ€¦ those who have fought for their rightsâ€¦ their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. 
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people. 
Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. 
Never, never be afraid to do what's right. 
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. 
It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. 
You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. 
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. 
Remember, laughter is 10 times more powerful than screams. 
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. 
The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. 
I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. 
What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our lives haven't even happened yet. 
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. 
And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store? What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more? 
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love 'til you give it away. 
My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. 
Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. 
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. 
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. 
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. 
At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplishedâ€¦ It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. 
We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. 
Joy; the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t depend on what happens. 
Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that itâ€™s meant to take you. 
Joy is not in things; it is in us. 
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. 
Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. 
Spirit is like the wind, in that we canâ€™t see it but can see its effects, which are profound. 
It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion. 
A smile is a light in the window of the soul indicating that the heart is at home. 
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. 
Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. 
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. 
We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. 
It's not necessarily the amount of time you spend at practice that counts; it's what you put into the practice. 
We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. 
Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine. 
Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. 
Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Donâ€™t miss it.  
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! 
I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. 
There is no joy in possession without sharing. 
Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. 
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. 
The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. 
Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. 
Tough times never last, but tough people do. 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. 
An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. 
The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.Â  Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything. 
A will finds a way. 
Obstacles donâ€™t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, donâ€™t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. 
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. 
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. 
Never, never, never give up. 
Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. 
Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. 
Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. 
Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. 
Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. 
True belonging doesnâ€™t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. 
Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. 
I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance. 
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. 
It is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are. 
Live your life by a compass, not a clock. 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.
